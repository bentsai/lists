=: title I love lists, too
I found this new lists.sh blogging platform which bills itself as "A microblog for lists". That's right up my alley. I bet the word "minimalist" is on the home pageâ€”yup, there it is.
It's simple. Write lists, where items can be paragraphs. I love the simplicity.
Maybe I can hook it up to some scripts or workflows that let me easily add lines via Raycast or something.
